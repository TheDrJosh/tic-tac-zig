# Tic Tac Toe - Zig

## What?

This is tic tac toe implemented in zig. It has 1 and 2 player modes. It also has configurable starting and computer player. It has 3 difficultys easy, medium, and hard.
You input your moves in the format "x,y" where x and y where are between 1 and 3 inclusive.

## Why?

I wrote this to learn zig and for that purpose I would call it a success. I learned the basics of zig and like it. One last think that I wish I learned was zig - c interop. I try to find a good cross platform terminal manipulation library to upgrade to graphics but the ones I try to heavly rely on conditional compilation which zig strugles some with.
